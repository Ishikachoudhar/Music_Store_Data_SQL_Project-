# Music_Store_Data_SQL_Project-
I'm thrilled to share my recent accomplishment of completing a challenging hashtag#sql project üñä . It was centered around Music Store Data #analysis . üíª 

Through this project, I was able to extract valuable insights from a dataset containing information about music sales with the help of various SQL clauses like SELECT, FROM, JOINS, GROUP BY, WHERE, HAVING, LIKE, ORDER BY, and TOP.

Additionally, I practiced a variety of questions ranging from easy to moderate difficulty levels. This exercise significantly contributed to sharpening my SQL query writing skills, enabling me to tackle complex data challenges with confidence.

I'm happy üòÅ to finish this project and to have broadened my data analysis skills, eagerly awaiting the next one!
